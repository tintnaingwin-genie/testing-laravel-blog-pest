[![Tests](https://github.com/spatie/testing-laravel-blog-pest/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spatie/testing-laravel-blog-pest/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)

## Blog demo application 

This repo contains the demo application used in the Pest flavour of the [Testing Laravel](https://testing-laravel.com) video course.

You can clone the repo, remove all the tests, and try adding the tests that we show in the videos. But what would be even better is that you try to add tests to an application of your own. 

In one of the first videos, we'll show you how to add a test to make sure that the homepage works. That would probably be a very good one for your app as well. If you see videos on how to add test for models, add tests for the models in your app, and so on.
